# Debugging

We provide a very in-depth debugging log. Running the app with the `debug` log_level should be only in rare cases.
We encourage you to use sn-edit with only the `info` level debugging for basic operations, because the `debug` level adds
overhead and might make the app slower in respect to the performance.

Before creating any issue for troubleshooting, we ideally require debug output from you, so we know in-detail what is happening
during the issue you are experiencing.
